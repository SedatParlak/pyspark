# Big Data Analysis with Python and Spark

This repository contains code and materials related to a Udemy course on analyzing big data with Python and Spark. In this course, you will learn how to use Spark's DataFrame syntax, MLlib library, and machine learning algorithms to perform data analysis and create predictive models. You will also work on consulting projects that mimic real-world situations, such as classifying customer churn with logistic regression and using Spark's gradient boosted trees for classification.

## Course Content

The course covers the following topics:

- Introduction to Spark and Big Data Analysis
- Spark 2.0 DataFrame Syntax
- Using Spark with Random Forests for Classification
- Using Spark's Gradient Boosted Trees
- Machine Learning with Spark's MLlib
- Creating a Spam Filter with Spark and NLP
- Analyzing Tweets in Real-Time with Spark Streaming

## Getting Started

To use the code and materials in this repository, you will need to have Python and Spark installed on your machine. The course recommends using the DataBricks platform, but you can also set up Spark on your own machine or use AWS EC2 instances. The repository includes example data and Jupyter notebooks with code examples.

## Consulting Projects

The consulting projects included in this course are based on real-world scenarios and provide practical experience with data analysis and machine learning. They cover topics such as customer churn, marketing optimization, and sentiment analysis.

## Credits

This course is taught by Jose Portilla, a data scientist, instructor, and entrepreneur with over 250,000 students on Udemy. The materials in this repository are based on his lectures and code examples.
